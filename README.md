### Core Functionalities & Tests

There is an Admin Authority that controls most of the program.
An entity - most likely an veterinary cabinet can join the eco-system.
It can add an animal owner, if the veterinary cabinet entity exists in the system.
It can add an animal for the owner, if the veterinary cabinet entity exists in the system.
The veterinary cabinet can mint an NFT as proof of license or to prove that it belongs to this eco-system.
The Animal owner can mint an NFT as proof that it belongs to this eco-system.
The Animal owner can mint an NFT for the animal that it own's as proof of ownership.

Some of the NFT's examples you can find here:
